More than 40 Mobile Testing Clinics Scheduled Statewide

Currently, there are 42 mobile testing events scheduled through August 4 with new testing events added regularly. Find a mobile testing clinic event near you at scdhec.gov/covid19mobileclinics.

Hospital Bed Occupancy
As of this morning, 2,925 inpatient hospital beds are available and 7,781 are in use, which is a 72.68% statewide hospital bed utilization rate. Of the 7,781 inpatient beds currently used, 1,148 are occupied by patients who have either tested positive or are under investigation for COVID-19.

How South Carolinians Can Stop the Spread
Evidence is increasing about the high rates of infection in people who do not have symptoms and don’t know they are infectious. This places everyone at risk of getting the virus or unknowingly transmitting it to someone else. Steps we can take to protect ourselves and others include:


	Practicing social distancing
	Wearing a mask in public
	Avoiding group gatherings
	Regularly washing your hands
	Staying home if sick
