COLUMBIA, S.C. —  As positive cases of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 are on the rise in South Carolina, the state is increasing its goal of testing approximately 110,000 residents per month to 165,000 residents per month by the end of the year.

Expansive testing is critical in quickly identifying hot spots, catching outbreaks before they spread, and indicating where resources are most needed in the state. Increased testing also helps provide a better understanding of the overall prevalence of the virus within South Carolina. In May, the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) and the South Carolina Hospital Association (SCHA) developed South Carolina’s testing plan in coordination with federal partners.

The original goal of 110,000 residents, roughly two percent of the state’s population, was exceeded for May. Today, that goal is increased to 140,000 for June, July and August and 165,000 for the rest of 2020.

DHEC, hospitals, health care providers, and community partners have been holding mobile testing clinics across the state in order to make COVID-19 testing accessibility to as many South Carolinians as possible, especially those in rural and underserved areas.

To find information for hosting a mobile testing clinic, visit scdhec.gov/covid19testing.

Currently, there are 79 mobile testing events scheduled through July 21 with new testing events added regularly. Find a mobile testing clinic event near you at scdhec.gov/covid19mobileclinics. Residents can also get tested at one of 167 permanent COVID-19 testing facilities across the state. Visit scdhec.gov/covid19testing for more information on permanent testing locations.
