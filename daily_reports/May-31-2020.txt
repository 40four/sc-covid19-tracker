South Carolinians Reminded to Take Actions to Limit Spread of COVID-19
As restrictions are reduced by reopenings, DHEC reminds South Carolinians of the importance of practicing proper health and safety steps to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

We realize that what we are asking everyone to continue to do is not easy. But what we’re calling on South Carolinians to do by continuing to practice social distancing, wearing a mask while in public, and limiting their close contacts is critical to controlling the spread of this virus, and ultimately, saving lives.

DHEC thanks all South Carolinians for their individual efforts to socially distance and take the other recommended precautions for protecting themselves and others.

Testing in South Carolina
As of May 30, a total of 206,247 tests have been conducted in the state (by both DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory and private labs). DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory is operating extended hours and is testing specimens seven days a week. The Public Health Laboratory’s current timeframe for providing results to health care providers is 24-48 hours.

Over 100 Mobile Testing Clinics Scheduled Statewide
As part of our ongoing efforts to increase testing in underserved and rural communities across the state, DHEC is working with community partners to set up mobile testing clinics that bring testing to these communities. Currently, there are 104 mobile testing events scheduled through July 2 with new testing events added regularly. Find a mobile testing clinic event near you at scdhec.gov/covid19mobileclinics.

Upcoming DHEC free mobile testing events for June 1, include:

Additionally, there are currently 162 permanent testing locations at health care facilities throughout the state. These testing sites can be found at scdhec.gov/covid19testing.

Percent Positive Test Trends among Reported COVID-19 Cases
As South Carolina increases testing, there will likely be more laboratory-confirmed cases. The total number of individuals tested yesterday statewide was

5,758 and the percent positive was 5.4%. When the percent positive is low, it may indicate that more widespread testing is being performed and the percent positive may more accurately reflect how much disease is present in the community.

*Note: The total number of individuals tested May 29 statewide was 4,917. With the 154 additional cases being reported for May 30, the percent positive reported yesterday has been updated to 8.5%.

Hospital Bed Occupancy
As of this morning, 3,798 inpatient hospital beds are available and 6,566 are in use, which is a 63.35% statewide hospital bed utilization rate. Of the 6, 566 inpatient beds currently used, 402 are occupied by patients who have either tested positive or are under investigation for COVID-19.
