DHEC Launches Radio PSA on How to Appropriately Wear a Mask or Face Covering
DHEC launched a new radio public service announcement (PSA) today to help raise awareness about the appropriate way to wear a mask or face covering. A link to the PSA is available here.

To help protect against COVID-19, DHEC encourages everyone to wear a mask covering whenever in public. When wearing a mask, South Carolinians should:


	Make sure you can breathe through it
	Wear it whenever going out in public
	Make sure it covers your nose and mouth
	Wash your hands before taking it on or off
	Wash after using


You should not:


	Use on children under age 2
	Touch the front of the mask
	Use surgical masks needed by healthcare workers


Homemade masks may reduce the amount of virus one breathes out and may prevent you from touching your nose and mouth. This measure is recommended to be used in situations where social distancing may be difficult to maintain like at a grocery store, pharmacy, etc. It is intended to protect others from people who may be infected with the virus and able to spread it but not showing symptoms yet.
