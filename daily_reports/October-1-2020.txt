Confirmed and probable deaths: please click here.

As we continue to make adjustments to our internal database for more streamlined tracking of electronically reported test results (both COVID-19 and other disease test results), today's case numbers remain expectedly low as they reflect only results submitted to DHEC by email or fax. Individuals who have positive test results are being notified of their results by their health care provider. We remain dedicated to clear and transparent reporting and will provide a breakdown of tests and results for the days impacted by this internal update.

Who Should Get Tested?
If you are out and about in the community, around others, or not able to socially distance or wear a mask, we recommend that you get tested at least once a month.

Routine testing allows public health workers to diagnose those who are asymptomatic and interrupt the ongoing spread of the virus. Learn more about who should get tested here.

437 Testing Opportunities Available Statewide
Testing for COVID-19 is essential because it helps identify people who are infected with the virus, whether they have symptoms or not.

DHEC is working with community partners to set up mobile testing clinics and make testing available in communities across the state. Currently, there are 149 mobile testing events scheduled through October 31 and there are 288 permanent COVID-19 testing facilities across the state.
